simple library to crop avatar image on a client and pass it on to a server.

I grew frustrated with cropping images and although there are many wonderful libraries out there, they just didn't cut it for me so I did my own.

What avatar does:

* loads up a dropped image
* resizses and crops it (inspired by twitter's avatar)
* then uploads crop-only to a server, don't really care about a master image

how does it work?

have a look at the html code, I made it purposely sterile, boring and simple.

questions?
